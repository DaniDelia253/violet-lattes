# Project Name
Violet Lattes (Ecommerce Site for Digital Art)

## Project Summary
This site is an online store that will allow artist Kirsten to sell her art.
On the home page, users will be able to see an overview of the artist's work, as well as a little bit of information about her. There will be a section called "Buy my Works" that will take the user to an online catalogue to view all available works. Each work will have a details modal that provides a description of the work, as well as the prices and the option to add it to the cart. There will be a section called "Commissions" that will allow the user to get in contact with the artist about commissioning a custom work. There will also be a "Contact Me" section with contact and social media information about the artist. 
The site will have a login feature that authenticates users using JWT. Authenticated users will be able to see their purchase history and make new purchases using the Stripe payment platform.
